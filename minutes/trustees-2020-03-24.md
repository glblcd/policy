## Agenda items

### Minutes from Last Meeting

The board signed off on the minutes from the last meeting.

### Issues arising

1. Sam gave an update as to our fundraising progress. We have raised north of GBP 21,000. Most of our spend has been on flights, with hardware (fully paid for via a large donation from David Mallon) and tshirts coming next. All our deposits have been paid. Paying balances to suppliers will require approximately GBP 2-3000 in further funds.
1. Sam gave an update as to the two operations in hand at the moment: the third annual Summer program and the Advanced Java 1-week class Sam is running with Ben Evans, our volunteer.
1. The trustees discussed the potential for travelling to a second country next year, and have agreed to push that discussion until the summer program is finished in August.

### Charitable aims

The attendees agreed that they were continuing to fulfil all the aims of the registered charity.

### Other Business
